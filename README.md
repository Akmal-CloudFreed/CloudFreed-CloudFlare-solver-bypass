CloudFreed is a powerful tool designed to bypass Cloudflare anti-bot protection, allowing users to access websites without being restricted by captchas or Cloudflare's security measures.

Once Node.js is installed, follow these steps to set up CloudFreed:

2. Extract the file.
3. Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where you have cloned/downloaded CloudFreed.

    ```
    alternatively, you can use:
    ```
    npm install
    ```
## Usage
